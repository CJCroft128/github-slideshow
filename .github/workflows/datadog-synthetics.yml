# This workflow will trigger Datadog Synthetic tests within your Datadog organisation
# For more information on running Synthetic tests within your GitHub workflows see: https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/cicd_integrations/github_actions/

# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.
